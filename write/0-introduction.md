# Accessible Design Knowledge

## Introduction

* There is a gap in design knowledge publication between industry and academia. [@lowgren2013]
* A lot of knowledge is produced, but is not made accessible, especially in industry
* Both industry and academia would benefit from more knowledge made accessible
* Two examples will illustrate how this could be done

## The state of design knowledge publication

* companies keep their design and development proprietary for quite obvious reasons
  * patents
  * competition, best of them all
  * making money
  * first to market
  * exclusiveness
  * intellectual property
* there are examples where opening up the process leads to: innovation, trust, better products, quicker development
* academia publishes in a linear format, which does not represent knowledge adequately

## Example I Open Innovation

IBM with Eclipse?

“Eclipse is a consortium of major software vendors, solution providers, corporations, educational and research institutions and individuals working together to create an eco-system that enhances, promotes and cultivates the Eclipse open platform with complementary products, services and capabilities.”

The Eclipse community embraces the importance of value capture. We are consciously focused on building a commercially profitable ecosystem

The Business Model for Open Source
- Shared implementations of infrastructure
- Save time to market
- Increase rate of standards adoption
- Reduce risk
- Provide thought leadership and first mover advantages

Vendors still compete!
- Product differentiating features
- Service, support
- Branding, channels

Transparent
- Project discussions, minutes, deliberations, project
plans, plans for new features, and other artifacts are open, public,
and easily accessible. 

The Eclipse open source community is uniquely focused on
achieving both goals associated with innovation networks:
- Open governance and development processes allow individuals and
corporations to co-operatively develop product-ready software (value creation)
- Focus on ecosystem opportunities supports use of this technology in successful products (value capture)

## Example II

Tesla / patents

## Ways forward

* Making use of open standards http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard
* Publishing non-critical internal documents - transparency
* Releasing patents
* Accompany the design & development process of a product with blog posts etc pp
* Document the process publicly - like many companies/agencies already do and use as an asset/for trust/as USP
* Make use of fitting representations of intermediate-level knowledge, kinda like annotated portfolios?

## Conclusion

We can learn much from open source and open innovation movements.
