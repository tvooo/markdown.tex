# WriTeX

> Create beautiful LaTeX documents with Markdown

Write in Markdown, compile from LaTeX. WriTeX gives you a workflow for creating print documents super-easily - the power of LaTeX with the simplicity of Markdown.

## Setup

Install WriTeX using npm:

```
npm install writex
```

WriTeX makes use of [pandoc]() and [LaTeX]().

## How it works

## Templates

There are two default templates for LaTeX documents in the `templates/` folder. They use KOMA-Script document classes
